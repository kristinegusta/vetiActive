                Is your four-legged friend not as eager for walks lately? Whether they're feeling stiff from arthritis,
                recovering from surgery, or just not moving as freely as before, physiotherapy can help!
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Through hands-on treatment and tailored exercises, I work to reduce your dog's pain, improve mobility,
                and restore comfort. My goal is to help them move more easily so you can both get back to enjoying
                walks, playtime, and everyday adventures together.
