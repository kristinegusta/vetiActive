                Is your horse feeling stiff, uncomfortable, or not performing as well as usual? Whether they’re
                recovering from an injury, dealing with muscle tension, or showing subtle signs of discomfort,
                physiotherapy can make a difference! </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                By combining soft tissue therapy, joint mobilization, high-power laser therapy, and targeted exercises,
                I help reduce pain, improve movement, and support recovery. A full assessment—both in motion and through
                hands-on examination—allows me to identify problem areas and create a treatment plan that helps your
                horse feel and perform at their best. </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                This version keeps the structure and tone consistent across both sections while making them clear and
                engaging. Let me know if you’d like any changes!</p>

                                ”My mare Novita had been stiff while riding and was experiencing problems in her neck
                                joints.
                                Elizabete came all the way to Belgium to help us. She immediately noticed Novita’s pain
                                points without me saying a word. She worked her magic and was able to relieve some of
                                the tension in her muscles.
                                The next time I rode her, she felt so much better.
                                We also discussed her training and how we could improve it to prevent future issues.
                                I will definitely ask Elizabete to come again.
